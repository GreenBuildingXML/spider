## Modules

The Ladybug Tools/Spider GbXML Viewer is a collection of small JavaScript files that work together to enable the viewing of [gbXML]( http://www.gbxml.org/ ) files.

The goals for the files include:

* Files are no more than a few hundred lines
* Code is simple, plain-vanilla JavaScript
* Every JavaScript file has an accompanying standalone HTML file for testing purposes
* Every JavaScript file has its own name space so you can quickly identify the location of variables and functions

The various modules are described below. They are listed in alphabetical order of their three letter folder/ name-space id.
