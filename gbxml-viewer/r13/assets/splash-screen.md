<summary>Welcome 2018-04-11 ~ R13.3</summary>


HUD /Head-up Display Module
* If gbXML file has only a single space:
	* Past: displays blank HUD
	* Now: displays relevant HUD data plus following message 'Model has only a single space, therefore there is no adjacent space data to be shown here.'

REP / Reports Module
* Element attributes starting to have buttons to update the display
	* Buttons for: ID, Surface type, Adjacent spaces, CAD object ID, Space and Zone
* Spaces report has zoom button

CSS / Style Sheet
* Better handling of sliding menus and pop ups on small devices
* Left menu needs more work

<summary>Welcome 2018-04-03 ~ R13.2.</summary>

REP / Reports Module
* Very reorganized / all functions based on set and get
	* Should be more maintainable and extendable
* Variable and function names with clearer / more self-evident structure

APP / Application Module

* Only a single Feature panel is visible at any given time
	* Multiple visible panels added complexity without much benefit

* Continue adding items to Reports, Issues and Numbers
* Establish three sets of CSS styles for:
	* "Archie" the architect: all Pastels/ Looks Like Apple made it
	* "Cody" the coder: White text on black
	* "Inge" the ingÃ©nieure: All the colors imaginable
