# About gbXML Viewer

<i>The Module Explorer button in the Left Menu enables you to access help, source code and support for every module in gbXML Viewer</i>
## Mission

* Browse and display numerous building models contained in [gbXML]( https://gbxml.org ) files as easily and as quickly as possible - at no charge
	* Load via URLs, file dialog box, drag and drop and more
* View each gbXML file as an interactive 3D building on your computer, tablet and phone
	* Mouse, stylus and finder-touch-enabled
* View all components contained in the gbXML files singly and collectively in 3D along with all text attributes
	* Interactive menu-driven user interface makes features easy to find
* Identify issues in gbXML file data that may impede loading into downstream apps
	* Identify faulty duplication, missing required items, reversed normals
* Calculate and display useful statistics such as areas, orientation and ratios
	* Window to Wall ratios for the eight compass directions, exposed to Sun surfaces and more
* Enable the updating and error-fixing of some aspects of the gbXML files as well as adding simple elements
	* Add ground planes, add colors of surfaces, create sections and exploded views
* Serve as an input/output engine for calculations performed by other apps. For example: Sun paths, fly-through's and more
	* Spin-offs are working with Node.js and on Amazon Web Services
* Integrate nicely into complex, ongoing large project web-enabled workflows
	* Save edits and apply these to the next release of the incoming files, play nice in an iframe, cross-origin-friendly
* Follow a simple coding style so that non-programmers can do simple edits and full-stack coders can fork to specialty environments
	* Based on the popular Three.js JavaScript WebGL library,

## Vision

* Provide access for clients, designers and non-technical people to easy-to-understand graphical representations of complex, big data paradigms
* Enable engineering professionals to advance into more sophisticated realms because the drudge-work is being taken care of
