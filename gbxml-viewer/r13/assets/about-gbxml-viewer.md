<i>The Module Explorer button in the Left Menu enables you to access help, source code and support for every module in gbXML Viewer</i>

## Mission

gbXML Viewer is a collection of modular experiments for viewing, examining and validating gbXML files in 3D in your browser.

Open, view and investigate gbXML files in 3D in your browser with free, open source entry-level JavaScript.

Objectives

* Load almost instantly
* Non-modal interface
* Fast effective workflow: get things done faster
* Full interactive 3D

Features
* Browse and display numerous building models contained in [gbXML]( https://gbxml.org ) files as easily and as quickly as possible - at no charge
	* Load via URLs, file dialog box, drag and drop and more
* View each gbXML file as an interactive 3D building on your computer, tablet and phone
	* Mouse, stylus and finder-touch-enabled
* View all components contained in the gbXML files singly and collectively in 3D along with all their associated text attributes
	* Interactive menu-driven user interface makes features easy to find
* Identify issues in gbXML file data that may impede loading into downstream apps
	* Identify faulty duplication, missing required items, reversed normals
* Calculate and display useful statistics such as areas, orientation and ratios
	* Window to Wall ratios for the eight compass directions, exposed to Sun surfaces and more
* Enable the updating and error-fixing of some aspects of the gbXML files as well as adding simple elements
	* Add ground planes, add colors of surfaces, create sections and exploded views
* Serve as an input/output engine for calculations performed by other apps. For example: Sun paths, fly-through and more
	* Spin-offs are working with Node.js and on Amazon Web Services
* Integrate nicely into complex, ongoing large project web-enabled workflows
	* Save edits and apply these to the next release of the incoming files, play nice in an iframe, cross-origin-friendly
* Follow a simple coding style so that non-programmers can do simple edits and full-stack coders can fork to specialty environments
	* Based on the popular Three.js JavaScript WebGL library,

## Vision

* Provide access for clients, designers and non-technical people to easy-to-understand graphical representations of complex, big data paradigms
* Enable engineering professionals to advance into more sophisticated realms because the drudge-work is being taken care of
* Help students, clients and non-AEC peeps gain access BIM data easily, quickly and freely
* Facilitate the transfer of data between design programs and analysis programs


### User experience

* Runs in your browser on computer, tablet and phone
* Highly adjustable workspace
* Movable, sliding resizable menus
* View the full gamut of data typically available in a gbXML file
* View gbXML files in 3D
* Full zoom, pan and rotate

## Coding Style

* All plain vanilla client-side JavaScript
* Built over the Three.js WebGL JavaScript library
* Uses Showdown to turn Markdown into HTML
* Every menu has own JavaScript file, HTML test file and read me
* Every menu has its own name space and only loads when first called
* Creates gbJSON data for easier processing
* All free and open source and hosted on GitHub


## Things you can do using this script

* Use one/two/three fingers to rotate/zoom/pan the display in 3D
	* Or left/scroll/right with your pointing device
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the [Stats]( https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/ ) box in the footer to toggle FPS / MS / MB views
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors
