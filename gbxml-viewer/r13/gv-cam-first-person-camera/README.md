## Full screen test: [gv-cam gbXML Viewer First Person Camera]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r13/gv-cam-first-person-camera/gv-cam.html )


Fly through and around your models. Use cursor keys or WASD keys. Click on the icons at bottom of your screen

This is a new and experimental feature.

Click on any of the files in the left menu. Once the model is loaded, you can ***click any of the icons at the bottom of the screen to get started***. After you have touched or clicked an icon you may also start to use your keyboard keys.

Your pointing device works as usual. You can pan zoom and rotate as you do normally


R key or Page Up key = turnUp

F key + Page Down key = turnDown

A key + cursor left key = turnLeft

W key + cursor up key = goForward

D + cursor right key = turnRight

S key + cursor down key = goBack

Plus key + plus numeric key = goUp

Minus key + minus numeric key = goDown

At the top of the screen there are two extra buttons

* Reset view: zooms out to the default view
* Over the shoulder: Zooms way into the model and lets you ride on the back of a 'tadpole' and you fly and wander around.

Flying nicely through a building takes a certain amount of skill and practice. Be patient with yourself and use the reset view button often.

Using the keyboard and the mouse or fingers at the same time can be very exciting!
