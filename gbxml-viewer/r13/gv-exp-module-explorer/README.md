Advocates
	* What can the app do? Can it do something I need to get done by today
	* What can I share with my colleagues that will demonstrate the utility of this app?
	* I'm writing an article, a list of features would really simplify things for me

Developers / 'You'
* Where is the source code for a particular feature?
* Can I use just a single aspect of this program in my program in a tidy fashion? Or will I have to fork huge chunks of code?

Developers / 'Us'
* How can we write text once and have the text in one place and yet use it everywhere?
* How can a single set of notes provide benefit to multiple audience types?
