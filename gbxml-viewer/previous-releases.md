# Previous gbXML Viewer Releases

Below are links to prior releases. Most releases have code that is running. They are linked here to help you understand how this code has grown and morphed. And to prove to you that code is not magic, but it is the product of human imagination and persistent efforts.

### [gbXML Viewer R9]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r9/gbxml-viewer9-app/gbxml-viewer9.html )

#### [gbXML Viewer R9 Robust]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r9/gbxml-viewer9-app/gbxml-viewer9-robust.html )

* Note that more recent version may well be more robust then this version. The link here is to remind one and all that special version can be built
* This is a special version of gbXML Viewer for very large files.
* Click 'choose file' to select a file. Then wait until all the bytes have been loaded - at least a full minute.
* And then wait a bit more and then click 'parse gbXML'.
* Also a good idea to refresh the page prior to loading file and to have the JavaScript console open.


### [gbXML Viewer R8]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r8/gbxml-viewer8-app2/gbxml-viewer8-app2.html )

### [gbXML Viewer R7]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/read-gbxml/gbxml-viewer/r7/index.html )

See also [R7 Read Me]( #read-gbxml/README.md ) for earlier changes

R6 is mostly broken and may be ignored. Perhaps the only script to consider is [gbXML Gallery]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/read-gbxml/gbxml-viewer/#r6/gbxml-viewer-small/gbxml-gallery.html ) where a gbXML Viewer is embedded inside a normal HTML file using an iframe.

### [gbXML Viewer R5]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/read-gbxml/gbxml-viewer/r5/index.html )


Prior to R5, releases were given code names that related to peeps involved with the project. This confused peeps - especially the peeps whose names were being flaunted.
