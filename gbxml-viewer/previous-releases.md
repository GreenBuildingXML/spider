# Previous gbXML Viewer Releases

Below are links to prior releases. Most releases have code that is running. They are linked here to help you understand how this code has grown and morphed. And to prove to you that code is not magic, but it is the product of human imagination and persistent efforts.

### [gbXML Viewer R11]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r11/gv-app/gv-app.html ) ~ 2018-03-02


### [gbXML Viewer R10]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r10/gbxml-viewer10-app/gbxml-viewer10.html ) ~ 2018-02-17


### [gbXML Viewer R9]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r9/gbxml-viewer9-app/gbxml-viewer9.html )


### [gbXML Viewer R8]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r8/gbxml-viewer8-app2/gbxml-viewer8-app2.html )


### [gbXML Viewer R7]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/read-gbxml/gbxml-viewer/r7/index.html )

See also [R7 Read Me]( #read-gbxml/README.md ) for earlier changes

R6 is mostly broken and may be ignored. Perhaps the only script to consider is [gbXML Gallery]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/read-gbxml/gbxml-viewer/#r6/gbxml-viewer-small/gbxml-gallery.html ) where a gbXML Viewer is embedded inside a normal HTML file using an iframe.

### [gbXML Viewer R5]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/read-gbxml/gbxml-viewer/r5/index.html )


Prior to R5, release were given code names that related to peeps involved with the project. This confused peeps - especially th peeps whose names were being flaunted.
