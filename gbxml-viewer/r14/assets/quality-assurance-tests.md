# gbXML Viewer Quality Arruance Tests

#### Theo 2018-06-16

This is a preliminary effort at creating some guidelines for testing the GB XML viewer. I know nearly nothing about how to test animated 3D applications in your browser. My quality assurance skills are still at a beginner level. I could use a lot of help here.

Every module should have its own set of tests that are independent of the other modules.
