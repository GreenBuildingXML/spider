## Concept

* Viewing gbXML data in 3D gives you a lot more options for displaying gbXML elements using informative methods
* Update the materials and colors for surfaces
	- Choosing random colors helps you identify how a wall might be composed of multiple gbXML surfaces
	- Choosing a solid shade helps you see shadows better
	- Exposure type surfaces help you see what surfaces face outdoors
* Exploded and Section Views
	* Allow you to inspect internal spaces that normally hard to see

## Mission

* Update a number of parameters to control the display and rendering of the gbXML file as a 3D model

## Features

* Adjust a wide variety of viewing parameters
* Control the appearance of the surfaces
	* Set default, random, Phong default, normal or exposure-type material to all surfaces
	* Update opacity sliders for building surfaces and openings
* Control the appearance of the scene
	* Toggle shadows, edges, surface normals
	* Toggle wireframe
	* Toggle gradient background
* Control the content of the scene
	* Toggle display of axes, grid and ground
	* Grid and ground located a bottom of exterior walls by default / location is adjustable
* Control the behavior of the scene
	* Toggle scene rotation (not in current release)
	* Toggle perspective and orthographic views
* Set and reset exploded 3D views
	* As a whole
	* By the storey
* Set section views along X, Y and Z axes
