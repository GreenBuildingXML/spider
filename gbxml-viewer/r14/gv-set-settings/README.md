## Concept


## Concept

* Update a number of parameters to control the display and rendering of the gbXML file as a 3D model.
* Viewing gbXML data in 3D gives you a lot more options for displaying gbXML elements using informative methods.
* Update the materials and colors for surfaces
	- Choosing random colors helps you identify how a wall might be composed of multiple gbXML surfaces
	- Choosing a solid shade helps you see shadows better
	- Exposure type surfaces help you see what surfaces face outdoors

## Features

* Adjust a wide variety of viewing parameters
* Control the appearance of the surfaces
	* Set default, random, Phong default, normal or exposure-type material to all surfaces
	* Update opacity slider
* Control the appearance of the scene
	* Toggle shadows, edges, surface normals
	* Toggle wireframe
	* Toggle gradient background
* Control the content of the scene
	* Toggle display of axes, grid and ground
	* Grid and ground located a bottom of exterior walls by default / location is adjustable
* Control the behavior of the scene
	* Toggle scene rotation
	* Toggle perspective and orthographic views
	* Set exploded 3D views
		* As a whole
		* By the storey
	* Set section views along Xm Y and Z axes
