## Full screen test script: [COR Core]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r14/gv-cor-core/gv-tmp.html )


## Concept


This folder contains the basic script that creates the menus, opens Markdown files, converts Markdown files to HTML
* View gbXML files in 3D in your browser.
* Open files using HTML5 File Reader or by URL in location.hash
* Base script used by all the other gbXML Viewer modules

Displaying the data in 3D using the [Three.js]( https://threejs.org ) JavaScript library is in the 'gv-thr' folder.

You may uses this script to verify that menus work as intended

* Sets default URLs
* Adds event handlers
* Handles location hash change events
* Makes XMLHttpRequest calls
* Handles FileReader requests
* Responds to drag and drop events
* Handles moving the menus by monitoring mouse and touch events
* Responds to calls to slide the left and right menus


needs combining with this read me
