## Concept

[Aragog gbXML Viewer]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider "Source code on GitHub" ) is a collection of [free, open source]( https://opensource.guide/ "Read all about it at OpenSource Guides" ) modular [JavaScript]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript "Callout to Brendan" ) / [WebGL]( https://www.khronos.org/webgl/ "Tip of the hat to Ken Russell" ) / [Three.js]( https://threejs.org/ "Hi Mr.doob" ) experiments hosted on [GitHub]( https://github.com/about "Beep for where the geek peeps keep" ) for viewing, validating and editing [gbXML]( http://gbxml.org "Where's your schema today?" ) files in 3D in your browser. gbXML is an industry supported file format for sharing building information between numerous building design software tools.

### Mission

The Ladybug Tools/Spider GbXML Viewer is a collection of small JavaScript files that work together to enable the viewing of [gbXML]( http://www.gbxml.org/ ) files.

The goals for the files include:

* Files are no more than a few hundred lines
* Code is simple, plain-vanilla JavaScript
* Every JavaScript file has an accompanying standalone HTML file for testing purposes
* Every JavaScript file has its own name space so you can quickly identify the location of variables and functions
