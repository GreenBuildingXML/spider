## Concept

[Aragog gbXML Viewer]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider "Source code on GitHub" ) is a collection of [free, open source]( https://opensource.guide/ "Read all about it at OpenSource Guides" ) modular [JavaScript]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript "Callout to Brendan" ) / [WebGL]( https://www.khronos.org/webgl/ "Tip of the hat to Ken Russell" ) / [Three.js]( https://threejs.org/ "Hi Mr.doob" ) experiments hosted on [GitHub]( https://github.com/about "Beep for where the geek peeps keep" ) for viewing, validating and editing [gbXML]( http://gbxml.org "Where's your schema today?" ) files in 3D in your browser. gbXML is an industry supported file format for sharing building information between numerous building design software tools.

For more details, see the [gbXML Viewer Read Me]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#gbxml-viewer/README.md )

## Release Wish list

This release is trying to move the effort from a single large monolithic app into a collection of targeted smaller apps.

Each app targets a specific use case. Each app uses its own mix of core scripts.

Benefits include
* Simpler testing . no longer need to test every module against every module
* All modules available all the time instead of being brought on board in a length time sequence

Complications
* Revision naming, numbering and access become complex operations

Needed

* Some way of gathering all the text edits from all the read me file updates so that you can see what's new today
