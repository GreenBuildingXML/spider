## Concept

Given hundreds even thousands of elements, it is helpful if calculations can be carried out to summarize aspects of the data

Calculate areas of items of interest
* Areas by Storey
* Areas by Surface Type
* Areas by Opening Type
* Areas by Exterior Surface
* Another type of calculation by compass orientation


### Features

* Calculate and display surface area statistics, ratios and orientation
* Areas by Storey
* Areas by Surface Type
	* Buttons toggle visibility of each surface type
* Areas by Exterior Surfaces
* Areas by Opening type
	* Reports areas of walls and openings and window to wall ratio
* Orientation for the eight compass sectors
	* Reports areas of walls and openings and window to wall ratios
	* Toggle visibility of each surface
* Toggle the visible elements
	* openings  surfaces  edges  all visible


## Wish list

* 2018-05-12 ~ Add Exposed to Sun area
* 2018-03-23 ~ Add data embedded in gbXML file where available
* 2018-03-23 ~ Add area by cad id group
* 2018-03-22 ~ Add calculate and show building bounding box
* 2018-03-22 ~ Add north point toggle < to settings?
* 2018-03-22 ~ Openings / make clickable / App to report


## Issues

Still a work-in-progress
* Is knowing the number of surfaces in a particular set interesting?
	* Could be added as a tooltip
