# gbXML Viewer R10

gbXML Viewer is a collection of free, open source of modular experiments for viewing, examining and validating [gbXML]( http://gbxml.org ) files in 3D in your browser.

In the Settings menu, the 'Explode view' feature is still not perfect but has been much improved.

_Please suggest what you would like to see here._

R10 first commit. A significant revision. The code is smaller, simpler and faster. About half the R9 code is in 10. The remaining modules should be available soon.

The interface give more emphasis to the model - and less to the menus. And, of course, new and more colors.
