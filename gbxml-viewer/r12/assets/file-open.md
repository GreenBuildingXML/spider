# Opening and loading files with gbXML Viewer


The goal is to have gbXML viewer open files in whatever way is best and fastest for you. There are many different kinds of workflows. We want to help you be as efficient as possible


### Use your operating system file dialog box

* Click to 'Choose File' button in the main menu

### Use Drag and Drop

* Select a file off your desktop of your file navigator/explorer
* Drag and drop it into the box surrounded by a dashed line

### Use a link

1. Copy and paste a hashmark('#')  followed by an URL to the end of the link to gbXML Viewer in the address bar of your browser
	* Example: http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/#https://rawgit.com/GreenBuildingXML/Sample-gbXML-Files/master/Urban_House_MEP.xml
2. Copy and paste a hashmark('#') followed b a relative link to the end of the link to gbXML Viewer in the address bar of your browser
	* Example: http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/#../../../gbxml-sample-files/RevitTwoSpaces.xml
3. Copy and paste a hashmark('#') followed by a file URI to the end of the link to gbXML Viewer in the address bar of your browser
	* See Wikipedia [File URI Scheme]() https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme )
	* See Stackoverflow [How can I create a link to a local file on a locally-run web page?]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18246053/how-can-i-create-a-link-to-a-local-file-on-a-locally-run-web-page/18246357 )

### Set a default file path

* Similar to using a link. All three methods should work
* Copy and paste a link - no the hashmark needed - into the default path text iuput box
* Every time you reload the page the default file will appear - even in between sessions
* To stop loading a default file just clear the default file text input box

### Do you want your colleague or client to see the file?

* Save the file to GitHub, DropBox or somewhere on the web with an URL
* Prepare a link using the 'Use a link' option and send the link to your client or cplleagu

### Are you loading the same file over and over again?

* In some workflows you may want to load, fix, test repeatedly. In these situation use the 'Set default file path';

### Do you need to inspect a lot of files quickly?

* Drag and and drop files into the Viewer
