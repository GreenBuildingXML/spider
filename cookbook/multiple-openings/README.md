Given a wall of given length and height somewhere in 3D space (large transparent rectangle), divide the wall into a given number of equally spaced areas (black lines). Then fill each area with a wall segment that has an opening. The size of the opening in relation to the wall segment is determined by a given window to wall ratio. Above each opening is an overhang of given depth. To both sides of each opening are fins of a given depth (thing at the front).
