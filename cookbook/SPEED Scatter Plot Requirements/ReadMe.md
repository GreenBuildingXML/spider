-Add design and performance constraints for the 198 run design space. Make the ranges of the sliders such that they are the max adn min of the parameteter range in the project (ME to do this).
-Moving constriants will grey out designs, make very light gray.
-Add Output Preference slider tied to selected output variables, each with a Minimize or Maximize toggle radio toggle.

-Make design points actual building geometry using geom.js code. 
-Make sure designs can scale appropriate so not all bunched up.
-The scatter plot needs a title.
-Show axis on scatter plot.
