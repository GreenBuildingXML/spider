## Concept

Given these two links:

* https://tt-acm.github.io/DesignExplorer/
* https://github.com/ladybug-tools/design_explorer_lite


### Mission
Is it possible to replicate much of the functionality of these two sets of scripts in a way that:

* Is built on easy-peasy code with few dependencies?
* Can do 80% or so of what these apps do?
* All values derived from CSV are set by algorithm - no human intervention needed to get going?

### Vision

* Exposes interesting new ways of visualizing the data?


### Features

* Interactive 3D chart running in your browser
* Slide in/out menu allows for viewing on mobile devices
* A variety of user-elected CSS themes are available
* Loads several sample charts with data hosted on GitHub
* Output data fields may be applied to XYZ axes, size, shape and color
	* Assignments may be user-selected and updated at runtime
	* Variable names, minimum values and maximums value are displayed 'in-world' for each axis
	* All data is normalized to fit in a user-friendly data display volume
* Mouseover any data point to
	* View its data in a heads-up display at top right of screen
	* View its associated image in the display
	* Currently selected items are made brighter and enlarge
* Filters generated by algorithm for all input variables
	* Filters adjust auto-magically to the currently loaded data set
	* Data fields that are lists of text items are filtered using buttons with names
	* Data fields that are series of numbers are filtered using minimum and maximum range sliders
* Code is under 1200 lines and generally fairly easy to read with no dependencies outside of Three.js



## To do / wish list

* 2018-08-25 ~ Theo ~ Add reset view / zoom all
* 2018-08-25 ~ Theo ~ Add random data generator
* 2018-08-24 ~ Theo ~ reverse the sort order of an axis
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Multiple simultaneous adjacent chart space volumes
	* With, say, each text field generating its own space
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Add direction, three axes of scale, opacity, color of edges as user-selected displays of output variables
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Add transparent planes to indicate current numeric min and max after filter applied
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Add convex shape bubbles around text filtered data points
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Add 'shadow' projects to each axis plane
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Better interaction when setting multiple filters
	* Currently the current filter update overrides all other updates
	* Handle steps in the data more effectively
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Better display of current values for numeric filters
	* Currently: only display as a tooltip
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Examples based on spreadsheet data
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Permalinks to user-select output data assignments
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Data export of data points selected by filtering
* 2018-08-23 ~ Theo ~ Explore sets of meshes or other ways of speeding up the generation and display of meshes
* 2018-08-10 ~ Theo ~ Add Pareto filters - see also Links of Interest section below

## Issues

* 2018-08-27 ~ Theo ~ Screen not rotating around the center of the geometry

***

The following sections - newest on top - are a show and tell of the adventures in responding to the above challenge.

The older versions load a demo file with over five thousand data points. The file takes fifteen seconds or so to load. Because of this slowness the iframes with demo of recent previous releases are mostly turned off. So in order to view these demos you must click the full screen demo links.

The slowness is almost entirely due to each data point being a displayed with a unique 3D mesh. Recent releases have fixes to this slowdown.

## Script 15 / 2018-08-25: Design Explorer Very Lite R11

### Full Screen: [Design Explorer Very Lite R11]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r11/design-explorer-very-lite.html )

* Add Ladybug Tools color palette
* Add interactive color legend - highlight selected data points by clicking on the color in the legend
* Move the directional light to positive X and Y / adjust the parameters
* Load and draw data points using requestAnimationFrame
	* Data starts appearing quite quickly
	* More fun to watch data appearing tan to look at a blank screen

### Full Screen: [Design Explorer Very Lite R10]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r10/design-explorer-very-lite.html )

* Add HTML5 range slide for minimum and maximum filters
* Update numeric filters UI
* Data points filtered out are grayed out and not just just made invisible
* Data points scale up in size on mouseover and down again on mouse out



### Notes

This release begins to feel as if this little project is becoming feature complete for its current stage of development. It's not quite yet ready for testing but certainly worth having a look. It will take another two or three releases to get this script shareable with generating too many issues.

For sure there are many small details to tweak. Numeric filters we are looking at you. Nonetheless, the main thrust of the project - view a multitude of multi-variable data items in interactive 3D environment with a user interface that enables a full system of data filters - is all progressing well.

Even more fun is the feeling that the code here is more than just for the Honeybee data. Design Explorer Very Lite looks feels like it may be readily adapted to display many types of complex data sets.

The significant downer is that the demo file first loaded has over five thousand records and takes about fifteen seconds to load.

Compare and contrast with a Google search on '3D scatter plot':

https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+scatter+plots&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS752US752&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X

You will be hard pressed to find a plot that is
* Interactive 3D
* Filterable in real time
* Axes and other output parameters are run-time user-selected
* Under 20KB of easy peasy JavaScript


Seems to be working in Chrome and Firefox

### Full Screen: [Design Explorer Very Lite R1]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r1/design-explorer-very-lite-r1.html )

First pass at gathering all the data and providing a display of the data
* Loads a CSV file which then loads all the JSON files and displays these in 3D
* RedBox is the default. All three data sets available with th click of a button
* Spacing and position is roughly calibrated on-the-fly for each data set

Comment 2018-07-28 21:44
* Well, it too a few hours more than I wanted, but at least there's something fun to look at
* There's nothing serious here yet, but at the least a proof of concept is in operation: we can load all th JSON files in a single visualization and manipulate the scene at a reasonable pace



## Script 5: View Design Explorer Data Three.js files R2

### Full Screen: [View Design Explorer Data Three.js files R2]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r1/view-design-explorer-data-threejs2.html )

A second pass at loading the JSON files into Three.js
* Some of the aspect of loading the Three.js JSON have been cleared up

-->

### Full Screen: [View Design Explorer Data Three.js files]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r1/view-design-explorer-data-three.js.html )

A first pass at loading the JSON files into Three.js
* Loads RedBox by default
* Buttons enable loading sample files from each of the three folders

Comments 2018-07-28 17:33

* Files load just fine using Three,js ObjectLoader
* Oh wow!. These files include scene data. It's like we are back at the AEC Hackathon in 2014. It was a mistake then (__mea culpa__). It's like a joke now.
* My bad. The files are OK. Scene data is not in the files. It's Object Loader or something creating the scene data.
* looks like I have some learning to do.
* 17:52 ~  Lesson learned. things seem to be working OK kind of




## Script 3: View Design Explorer Data CSV files

<!--
<iframe src=https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r1/view-design-explorer-data-csv-files.html width=100% height=400px >Iframes are not viewable in GitHub source code view<</iframe>
-->

### Full Screen: [View Design Explorer Data CSV files]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r1/view-design-explorer-data-csv-files.html )


A first pass at reading the CSV files
* Buttons allow you to load the data from each of the three files. RedBox is loaded as the default
* Uses a JavaScript fetch to obtain the file as text
* Parse the text data into an array of lines, each of which is an array of data points
* Use the data to fetch and display all the PNG files
* Click the PNG to enlarge and get an alert of the parameters for that file

Comments 2018-07-28 16:21
* Well, that was easy
* Issue needs two clicks to shrink the PNG file



## Script 2: View Design Explorer Data JSON files

<!--

-->

### Full Screen: [View Design Explorer Data JSON files]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r1/view-design-explorer-data-json-files.html )

A first pass at reading the JSON files
* Uses the GitHub API to ob2ain a list of file names
* Using that list downloads and creates buttons with links to the files
* Buttons allow you to select the file and view its contents as stringified JSON

Comments 2018-07-28 14:37
* Of Wow! They are storing 3D data using Three.js JSON. Interesting choice. I wonder why they picked this file format instead of a more lightweight format such as OBJ or STL or an industry standard such as DXF, RAD or gbXML
* Hm. I thought there would ve various data parameters contained in each JSON file. but no, the data is quite minimal just geometry, material and a bit of layer data to indicate construction material.
* Ah! the 'parameter' data ~~are~~ is in individual CSV files in the parent file. And it includes the file names of both the PNG and JSON files. So now lets hit on that file. ;-)


## Script 1: View Design Explorer Data PNG files

<!--

-->

### Full Screen: [View Design Explorer Data PNG files]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#cookbook/design-explorer-very-lite/r1/view-design-explorer-data-png-files.html )

A first pass at reading the PNG files.
* Uses the GitHub API to obtain a list of file names
* Using that list downloads and displays the files
* Buttons allow you to select the folder
* Click images repeatedly to enlarge and shrink
* Tooltips display file name

Comments 2018-07-28 13:07
* I though the file names might contain useful data, but each folder uses a different naming convention so no significant data can be extracted or inferred from the names without prior knowledge of its schema
* So let's look at the JSON files


### Issues

[DefaultData]( https://github.com/tt-acm/DesignExplorer/tree/gh-pages/design_explorer_data/DefaultData )
* This data set was built with an earlier release of Three.js
* It does not work with any release after R81
* The XYZ data is is compressed in one direction and stretched in another, if this file is of interest it will bee a custom script to display nicely
