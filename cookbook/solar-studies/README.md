So this is the start of building some kind of solar analysis thingy. I have no idea where this will go and have no technical competance in the area. I am but a humble architect and have little understanding of what this thing should do or could be. Moreover I have no idea about how to code this thing let alone what algorithms will be needed.

Things we know:

* Modern technology is allowing us to study the formerly too difficult to study
* Normal people need more and better tools to understand what is going on in technical areas like this


Given surfaces, vectors and formulas - all of which may vary of periods of time - we want to be able to assign and store values for each surface given a specified series of vectors. Both of which - along with other parameters - may be used as variables in formilas used to produce the desired results. Or something like that.

Shadows generated by rendering software may be of some use but provide few goodies in terms of coming up with verifiable, numeric results.


Givens:
* Any date and time
* Any latitude and longitude
* Any weather conditions available view an EPW files
* Any geometry from Revit or similar program exported in gbXML format
* Any topology
