Ahhhh, and so take another stand against the gbXML challenge! I believe we close. There are quite a few open source codes out there to help with this, but it's truly easier just do it ourselves, and we are not going from the ground up anymore, we are almost to the mountain top. I'm going to give a simple conceptual example, then a reverse engineering gbXML from OS, then take some current speed-specfication exports and point out what I need needs to be changed. I bet you with a day or two of close coordination, we can knock this out once and for all!:)






Length, height, center point, azimuth and tilt?
Three x,y,z points?
Vertical walls only?
Orthogonal/ tied to X-axis or Y-axis walls only?
