## [footprints ringed with objects]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/cookbook/footprints-ringed-with-objects/footprints-ringed-with-objects.html )


## Concept

Using various polygonal footprints, create building envelope schematics that could be used to generate gbXML files


The example is set up to help you find errors and find things to fix. Various elements are separated and colored so as to be able to be easy to indentify in the code.
