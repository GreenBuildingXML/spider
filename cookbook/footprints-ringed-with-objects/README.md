## [footprints ringed with objects]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/cookbook/footprints-ringed-with-objects/footprints-ringed-with-objects.html )


## Concept

Using various polygonal footprints, create building envelope schematics that could be used to generate gbXML files

Please note that this is a coding example. It is not a demo for end users.

The example is set up to help you find errors and find things to fix. Various elements are separated and colored so as to be able to be easy to indentify in the code.

Programmers need to know that everything is there always. If you can't see it how do you know it's there? If you have to turn it on to view it - and you are reloading several time a minute then you waste tons of seconds seconds click to make stuff visible. After a while you say to yourself: show me always.

Not everything is drawn. For example, this demo creates a single slab per story and does not really identify if the slab is slabongrade/roof/ceiling whatever. The geometry is there for you to name, color, ID, duplicate, copy, or manipulate any way you wish. Creating the irregular shape is the critical thing. Duplicating the geometry 10 feet up  or down is trivial
