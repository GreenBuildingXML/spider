## Concept

Inexperienced designers are bewildered by the complexities of creating Solar visualizations. The productivity of professionals is bogged down by the technical machinations of running the tools.

Solar visualizations that run in your browser and may be operated by newbs and pushed to the limits by the pros could be enlightening.



## Wish list
