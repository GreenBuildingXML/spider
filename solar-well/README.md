_View Radiance files in 3D in your browser_

## Concept

Inexperienced designers are bewildered by the complexities of creating Solar visualizations. The productivity of professionals is bogged down by the technical machinations of running the tools.

Solar visualizations that run in your browser and may be operated by newbs and pushed to the limits by the pros could be enlightening.

***

The scripts in this folder are of a variety of efforts: some request-driven, some learning experiences and some experiments.

The Radiance effort is just because it's high time the Radience effort joined the Internet.

The SunCalc effort is the Spider move from the NRAA Solar calculator over to the Agafonkin calculator

The Sun Range files are an effort to capture the shadows for one day a month for 14 hours per day purely in JavaScript

As time goes on, we hope to connect the various scripts in various fun ways.

## Wish list

* People help us come up with a mission and vision
* Display Radiance calculation results in your browser
