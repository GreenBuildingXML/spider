## Full Screen: [Single Model Multiple Menus]( https://ladybug-tools.github.io/spider/sandbox/single-model-multiple-menu/index.html )


## Concept

### Needs

* Switch between _[Flatland]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland )_ stuff and 3D models seamlessly
* Maintain 3D context/scope while switching menus
* Enable multiple menus to interactively enable adding, editing and deleting data in the 3D model
* Everything entry-level JavaScript
	* lots of small files / nothing big to slog through
* Apart from primary libraries - Three.js for 3D and Showdown for Markdown - no external dependencies
* All menus also available as standalone, testable HTML files
* Feel assured that no data is lost when looking at text content web pages

## Notes

* Is it a nice thing if styles and behaviors that control content are really close to the content they affect?
* If a style element is used just once, why not keep it with the element it is styling?
