## Full Screen: [Build Well qLine]( http://ladybug-tools.github.io/spider/sandbox/build-well-qline/index.html )


## Concept

An alternative to: http://rawgit.com/ladybug-tools/spider/master/build-well/r11/build-well.html


The code here is based on the idea of extruding a shape and making that shape follow a given path.

The code handles any shapes squares,, rectangles, stars, irregular polygons and so on. Whatever comes out of a pasta machineetc.

The path of extrusion - currently 2D only - can be made up of straights and curves. Pretty much whatever you cane create as a line in SVG can be used here.



## Naming considerations

AutoCAD has a marvelous 2D drawing command titled 'polyline' - often called 'pline'

If one were to invent a new drawing command - designed to be what comes after the pline, then maybe it could be called a 'qline'. As in what comes after the letter P? ;-)
