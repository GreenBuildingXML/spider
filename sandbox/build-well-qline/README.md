## Full Screen: [Build Well qLine]( http://ladybug-tools.github.io/spider/sandbox/build-well-qline/index.html )


## Concept

This side project is an alternative to: http://rawgit.com/ladybug-tools/spider/master/build-well/r11/build-well.html

The code here is based on the idea of extruding a shape and making that shape follow a given path.

The code handles any shapes squares,, rectangles, stars, irregular polygons and so on. Whatever comes out of a pasta machine etc could be replicated here.

The path of extrusion - currently 2D only - may be made up of straights and curves. Pretty much whatever you can create as a line in SVG can be used as the path of the Qline.

Another thought is that there is no intention to create anything that looks 'realistic'. The idea here is to generate schematics quickly and easily. In order to speed the process a number of shapes can be displayed simultaneously. 

One you are happy with a selection, adjacent buildings could be added and the ensemble exported as a gbXML file. When projects need to be shown to clients, then the files may b open and displayed using gbXML viewer.

And, as always, it's nice to have to see things in a fun, colorful game-like fashion.

## Naming considerations

AutoCAD has a marvelous 2D drawing command titled 'polyline' - often called 'pline'

If one were to invent a new drawing command - designed to be what comes after the pline, then maybe it could be called a 'qline'. As in what comes after the letter P?
