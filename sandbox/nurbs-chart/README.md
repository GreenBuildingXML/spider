## Concept

### Issue / The problem to be solved

Generating smooth meshes from a limited number of controls points is tricky.

[NURBS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline ) offer a good solution

Three.js has a NURBS plugin

This is a preliminary example just to get going. It would be great to have some sample data to graph

### Mission

* Simple ways of generating complex curves
* Useful for charts
* Useful for 3D modeling

### Vision

* One day: create a routine that creates a smooth transition between two NURBS surfaces

* Add vertex color according to rules
* Display location of control points
* User control over opacity and other material characteristics
* Multiple layer charts
* Display vertex and face normals
* Heads up display with details regarding current location
