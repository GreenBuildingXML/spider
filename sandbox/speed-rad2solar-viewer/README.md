# [SPEED Rad2Solar Viewer Read Me]( #sandbox/speed-rad2solar-viewer/README.md )


## Concept

--HTML Layout--

As you do now, there should be one button to import a single .rad file. This is for viewing .rad files for test cases as they are generated.

Also, there should be a button to import "Import RAD2Solar Project", and the import button should load a directory. The directory that is selected will have a .rad file and all the corresponding bitmaps.

Down below, where you have "Sample files", please eliminate all the existing rad files from various sources and just provide shortcuts to the .rad file in each "test-cases/test-case-x/ folders.

Please also make a drop down for "Sample projects". This will provide shortcuts to the folders within "test-cases/".

Please provide two toggle buttons: (1) "Hide .rad" and (2) "Hide .bmps". This will be useful when viewing a project.
