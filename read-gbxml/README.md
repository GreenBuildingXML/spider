## Concept

### Issue / The problem to be solved

About gbXML

> gbXML allows disparate 3D [building information models (BIM)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling ) and architectural/engineering analysis software to share information with each other

The current set of [BIM authoring and CAD software tools]( http://www.gbxml.org/Software_Tools_that_Support_GreenBuildingXML_gbXML ) for gbXML include proprietary, closed source applications.

gbXML being open source, it would be nice to be able to view gbXML files in 3D in your browser with no fees and with open source code

The Ladybug Tools Spider gbXML Reader scripts are first steps toward making gbXML viewers readily available


### Mission

* View gbXML files in 3D in your browser
* Full zoom, pan and rotate
* Run on computer, tablet and phone
* Adjust a wide variety of viewing parameters
* View the full gamut of data typically available in a gbXML file
* Open files via URL or open file dialog
* All free and open source hosted on GitHub


### Vision

* Helping students, clients and non-AEC peeps gain access BIM data easily, quickly and freely
