Ladybug Tools Manifesto
===


_2017-06-10 ~ Theo Armour ~ I prefer writing with lots or preferences and links - 'standing on the shoulders of giants', etc. But in this first pass, I'm mostly working from memory._


## Names

Establishing both brand and product identification is quite a tricky thing.

Somebody says 'I have an apple'. This could mean they have a computer, phone, tablet or fruit. Yet nobody says they have a 'Microsoft'. Is 'Ford' a company or a car?

The name of our organization contains the word 'Ladybug' and the name one of the four products contains the word 'Ladybug'. Could the overlap of words cause issues?

Using the names of insects has been a wonderful product naming strategy.  Using the name of one of the products as part of the corporate name may well lead to issues.

'Ladybug Tools' is fine for now, but it may be a good thing to have some discussion regarding naming strategies for the long term.

### Logo

Logo with four insects is fin for now. But consider what happens when there are more insects? Or when one of them dies?

## Legal Structure and Accounts

It's a good thing to pay for legal costs and accounting out of revenue and not out of pocket. I am happy to work on a handshake basis until money is coming in. Early on I am happy with running out of a personal checkbook and credit card, but even better with just a PayPal account.

An interesting question is what is the trigger point for establishing things on a proper basis?

Here's a possible benchmark: The average price of a car.

On this basis, let's say that once turnover reaches $3K per month ( $36,000 in a year or the price of a car) then it's worth establishing things on a more definite basis. Until income reaches that level, it's not worth considering the additional legal and backing fees.

## Mission Statement

One of my favorite books is Alexander _et al_'s [_A Pattern Language_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language ). Patterns are described thus:

	Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

	Patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.


It's a good idea when starting a new venture to describe the problems and issues and the describe possible methods for solving those problems.

Currently the mission statement is as follows:

	Develop open, performance-based solutions for the built environment.

It's still quite vague and not well-defined.

It would be a nice thing to have a file on GitHub where we can set down some of the problems we are trying to help people solve for them selves/

And there's more:

* Mission * a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future
* Vision - a descriptive picture of a desired future state


### Good Questions to ask oneself

There are any web pages like these, but here are two recent ones.

* https://hackernoon.com/10-questions-to-ask-every-startup-founder-c64e1b6deb5b
* https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241122

What is a good set of questions we should be asking ourselves?

## Tools to build tools to build tools

* The contractor hands the client a pile of warrantees and manuals
* The engineers and architect hand over a pile of drawings to the contractor
* AutoCAD, Rhino and Revit are used to create bunches of drawings for architects and engineers
* Grasshopper and Dynamo re used to tweak the designs built with the CAD programs
* Ladybug and friends are used to generate Grasshopper and Dynamo scripts
* Python, JavaScript and other languages are used to build Ladybug
* A bunch of tools are used to create, edit and revise the source code of the scripts

It's more complicate than you thought. And did you know that there's a whole new profession - called 'devops' - that's being created to help this problem become even more professional.

### We build tools

What does this mean?

Everything we do is off a single server. GitHub's for now.

Marketing peeps can use Google Gocs and Trello.  LiknkedIn, Twitter and Facebook are nice ways of staying in touch with friends. Sometime they help with sales.'

But anything to do with code is on Gitub

### We are open source

To be open source means to have no secrets. It mean that decisions are made in public.

If the source code is public and the thought process leading up to the lines of code that were written should be public as well.



##  We build tools

Some people build pretty web sites. Some people use the web to sell things. Whatever. We code the code others want to use.

The more we code the better we are.

So:

Everything is on GitHub. It's all under revision control. Dialog is via Issues. Bigger thoughts held in Markdown Files.

The web presence is via GitHub pages. Wherever possible:

The code we write asserts itself automatically into our web presence.  We use the GitHub API identifies changes to thee tools we build and updates the web presence accordingly.

Any text we write is mostly in Markdown format. This is automagically turned into HTML on the fly.


## We write for coders

The people who use our tools are coders who use our stuff to improve their web presence or their presentations to clients.

Pretty is nice but useful is more useful.

On the other hand we can scream heat, light and energy

## We don't write for programmers

If you are a full-stack developer, if you do devops before breakfast, then we probably can learn something from you - just as long as it's not too much.

We want the science complex and the code easy. Not the other way around.

We do real-time, online 3D STEM.

We need if conditionals, for-to loops and equal signs - and that's about it.
